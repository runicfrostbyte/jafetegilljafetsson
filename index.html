      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p>I currently have one game published on Steam:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trawlers Empire</strong> – A strategic tycoon game where players build a fishing empire across the seas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I previously released a game called <strong>EarthClicker</strong>, but it was retired from the Steam store due to its underperformance. My focus remains on delivering quality and immersive game experiences.</p>

      <h2>Travels</h2>
      <p>I have traveled to a total of three countries outside of Iceland:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>United States (Florida)</strong> – My first international trip was with my mother, sister, older half-brother, and grandmother (my mother’s parent), as part of Icelandair’s Vildarbörn campaign. The experience was challenging due to poor air quality and high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Greece (Rhodes)</strong> – A group trip in 2024 with Hitt Húsið, funded by Erasmus+. During this trip, I visited two additional islands by a small crew boat owned by Greece and Turkey. We first arrived at <strong>Symi</strong>, followed by <strong>Parnomitis</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Denmark</strong> – My first time visiting after Greece, before returning home to Iceland.</li>
      </ul>
